# A Space for Unburdening

This page serves as a personal outlet, a space to share thoughts and emotions that felt too raw or lengthy for typical social media. It's a direct outpouring, unfiltered and perhaps a bit rough around the edges.

## Purpose

This wasn't written for likes or shares, but as a way to process and express some heavy emotions. It's a message intended for those who know me, even if our connection exists in the quiet spaces.

## Content Warning

Please be aware that the content on this page contains strong language and deals with themes of grief and loss. Reader discretion is advised.

## Technical Details

This page was created using HTML and hosted via GitHub Pages. It's a simple way to share longer-form content without the constraints of other platforms.
